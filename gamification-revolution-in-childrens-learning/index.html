    <h2>The Project and My Role</h2>
    <p>WhiteHatJR is a platform where children learn how to code. We wanted the children to have fun while learning and enjoy the process. </p>
    <p>The objective was to improve class completion rates, renewal rates, and project completion rates using gamification.</p>
    <p>There were three aspects to this,</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Points</b> - Students gained points for each activity they performed on the platform.</li>
        <li><b>Badges</b> - For special activities or activity streaks, students earned badges.</li>
        <li><b>Leaderboard</b> - Students competed against each other on a weekly leaderboard.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I was part of a four member team, insisting of two product managers, one UX writer, and me as the designer.</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgksx9vlc/image/upload/v1639732725/Frame_48095747_wrx6bi.png" alt="">
        <span>The Team</span>
    </div>
    <p>I worked on this project for 3 months from July 2020 to October 2021.</p>
    <p>My role included,</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Ideation with the Product team</li>
        <li>Conducting User Interviews</li>
        <li>Wireframing and Interface Design</li>
        <li>Illustrations for Badges</li>
        <li>Co-ordinating with Developers to share assets and testing the final product for design suggestions</li>
        <li>UAT on the final product</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>We started only with a broad idea on what we wanted to achieve. We had to work closely with the product managers to while creating the requirements.</p>
    <p>Since this is a children's product, we needed to design without our own biases and constantly test it with children to make sure that the visuals and language were appealing to them.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>We interviewed our students regarding the games they played and the videos they watched online. We used these insights to draft the terminology and gameplay on our platform.</p>
    <p>The themes - Science, Space, and Travel ranked highly among the children. Our UX writer used these to come up with names and descriptions for the badges, as well as stages/levels for the leaderboard.</p>
    <p>We also studied the two most popular games among our students,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dota 2</li>
        <li>Clash Royale</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The User</h2>
    <p><b>Student</b> - The user is a 6-14 year old student. Their aspirations are to learn coding in an enjoyable way.</p>
    <p>To achieve these aspirations, they need to attend classes, complete their homework assignments on time, and be motivated to use the platform everyday.</p>
    <p>Student's were interested in science, space exploration, and travel</p>
    <p>Student's enjoyed playing games like Clash Royale, Fortnite, and Dota 2.</p>

    <h2>Building Points into the System</h2>
    <p>Like any game, we first needed a basic currency unit. For us, it was points. Students get points when they do activities on the platform (such as attend a class, or complete an assignment). We wanted to find a good represention for points, as well as show how many points a student will get for each activity and use that as an incentive to get students to complete certain activities.</p>

    <h2>Points Animation</h2>
    <p>Each time the student won points, we wanted to show how their position on the leaderboard was affected by it. This was a big boost for the kids since they got instant gratification for the activity they completed.</p>

    <h2>Making Badges</h2>
    <p>Badges helped us promote certain activities. The design challenge with badges was to first understand what type of badges appealed most to children between 6-14 years of age. We created a mood board and tested different themes and illustration styles.</p>
    <p>There were three foundational designs to be created,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Illustrating the badges</li>
        <li>Showcasing badges</li>
        <li>Promote badges on various activity pages</li>
        <li>Celebrate a student winning a badge</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I created a moodboard of badges we collected from the internet. I then had interview sessions with 10 students to see which styles they liked the most.</p>

    <h2>Showcasing badges</h2>
    <p>Below I’ve shown the three different options we wireframed for badges, and the final one that we went ahead with after testing with some students.</p>
    <div class="image-container">

        <span>Modal displaying details of a badge</span>
    </div>
    <h2>Nudges on the Activity Pages</h2>
    <p>We needed to make sure the students were contextually made aware of the badges. We wanted to show badge nudges on the page where the student accesses their activities. For example, showing the Quiz Master badge on the quizzes page. </p>
    <p>There were two types of nudges we explored. First is a short nudge, simply indicating how far the student is from the next achievable badge.</p>
    <p>The second option shows the complete set of badges for a specific activity.</p>
    <p>We went ahead with the first option because we didn’t want to overwhelm the students with the full list.</p>

    <h2>Badge Celebration</h2>
    <p>Celebrations are a key motivator in children’s learning. Getting a badge was one such milestone and we wanted to have a grand celebration for the same.</p>
    <p>I created the animation and picked appropriate sound effects. Discussed the feasibility with developers and got the following animation implemented.</p>    
    <p>Students were thrilled to see this, and even called their parents to show it to them.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <video src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgksx9vlc/video/upload/v1638650029/badge-reveal_ecdape.mp4" controls></video>
    </div>
    <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
    <p>We wanted to launch a leaderboard that gave the student a sense of progression and kept them wanting more even after winning.</p>
    <p>We wanted to create a leveling system, where each week that the student finished in the top 10 of the leaderboard, then the student was moved to a higher league. </p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dgksx9vlc/image/upload/v1638650359/leaderboard-1_vdxot1.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>We made some quick mockups and reached out to students. Student interviews revealed two major problems,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Students failed to understand that they needed to maintain their position in the top 10 till the end of the week. The assumption was that as soon as they entered the top 10 they would be moved to the next level.</li>
        <li>New Students did not understand how to earn points.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We iterated over the mockups and content a few more times and tested with students until we were satisfied with the layout and direction. Learnings and decisions based on the reasearch,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduce onboarding slides to build the narrative for the student</li>
        <li>Finalising on the theme of “Mountains”, since students found it interesting and clearly understood progression across the levels.</li>
        <li>Show tasks that the student can complete in order to earn points.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image-container">

        <span>Leaderboard Designs</span>
    </div>
    <p>I created a quick Code Pen to explain the sticky position interaction on scroll to make sure that the student's own rank is always in view.</p>
    <div class="embed">
        <p class="codepen" data-height="572" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="wvoKRGr" data-user="karanwhjr" style="height: 572px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

          </p>
          <script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
    </div>
    <h2>Impact and Future Scope</h2>
    <p>At first we decided to measure the impact of gamification based on renewal rates and we saw that students that participated regularly in the leaderboard saw a higher renewal rate. But, this could be attributed to causation rather than correlation.</p>
    <p>We interviewed students a week after the feature was released and it revealed that students understood and enjoyed collecting points and badges.</p>
    <p>Some students were very competitive on the leaderboard and we received suggestions from parents to reveal the breakdown of how other students were earning points so there would be more transparency.</p>
    <p>We saw an uptick in Projects being completed on time, as well as Quiz completions.</p>
    <p>Students were completing the leaderboard leagues faster than we enticipated, and we soon had to introduce addtional leagues.</p> 
    <p> We later added a Points MarketPlace which helped boost the value of the points and improved student’s engagement with the platform even further.</p>
