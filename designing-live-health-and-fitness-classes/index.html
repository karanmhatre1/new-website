    <h2>The project and my role</h2>
    <p>GOQii provides a Fitness band and Health Coaching to its customers. Customers buy the fitness band (that tracks their heart rate, and step count), and download they download the app. Then the Health Coach gets in touch with them and helps them achieve their fitness goals (like losing weight, or running a marathon). On the app, customers can additionally,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Buy health products (like protein shakes, and health bars)</li>
        <li>Browse through their health data</li>
        <li>Connect with other GOQii members on a community forum.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image-container">

        <span>GOQii Preventive Healthcare</span>
    </div>
    <p>We wanted to launch a new vertical in the app called GOQii Play - A live video health class with coaches and experts. The purpose was to help users with exercises and get industry experts to answer their health-related questions. We wanted to do a live platform so that it can feel more personal to the user than watching YouTube videos.</p>

    <p>We would look at the following metrics to measure the impact of this feature,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Adoption of the feature among existing GOQii players</li>
        <li>Improvement in new subscriptions over time</li>
        <li>Impact on renewal rates of subscription.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was the Product Manager and UX Designer on this project along with a Market Researcher, Graphic Designer, one android developer, and one backend engineer.</p>

    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p>We conducted 10 user interviews to understand user behaviour and current trends. We asked the following questions,</p>
    <p>This qualitative study helped us craft a more objective survey that we sent to 500 GOQii users as well as 1000 non-GOQii users.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">

        <span>User Interview Questions</span>
    </div>
    <p>We got the following insights from the interviews and survey,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users are interested in online exercises</li>
        <li>Users care about the credentials of the content creators</li>
        <li>Users do not currently attend any Live exercise classes online</li>
        <li>Users are keen to get exercise content in their regional language</li>
        <li>Users did show interest in attending live exercise and health classes if it was not very expensive and had coaches with good credentials.</li>
    </ul>    
    <p><i>[Numbers have been hidden for confidential purposes]</i></p>

    <h2>Tests with Facebook Live</h2>
    <p>To test the concept further, we started to conduct Live Classes on Facebook Live and YouTube Live. We marketed it in the GOQii app and monitored click rates. We tested with multiple banners and messages. We saw promising results. This helped us build more faith in our direction, and understood the type of content that worked well before investing in getting more coaches on board.</p>
    
    <h2>The User</h2>
    <p>Based on our research we created a couple of sample personas ot help us build a uniform image of the user</p>
    <div class="image-container-small">

        <span>User Persona</span>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
    <p>You studied the current live streaming platforms to begin with. These had a lot to offer in terms of what designs users were already familiar with. We looked at,</p>    
    <ul>
        <li>YouTube Live</li>
        <li>Facebook Live</li>
        <li>Instagram Live</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image-container-small">

        <span>Competitor Analysis</span>
    </div>
    <p>All platforms had relatively simple UIs with chat, share, and likes as the call-to-actions for the users.</p>
    <p>We stuck to a layout closer to Facebook live since that was the most familiar for users in the India at the time.</p>

    <h2>User Flow</h2>

    </div>

    <h2>v1: Minimum Viable Product</h2>
    <p>We decided to have the following features in the first launch of the product,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User can view the schedule of upcoming classes</li>
        <li>User can attend the class on the app</li>
        <li>User can post comments during the class</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We kept it basic. Enough to test our concept and get some additional engagement on the platform.</p>
        
    <p>The GOQii Play feature had to rest in the same GOQii app as everything else. This meant finding a way to cohesively merge it into the existing app without disturbing the user’s current flow.</p>
        
    <p>We trained some of the in-house coaches to take video classes. We had them stream from a third party RTMP supporting app, and read user comments on a temporary web page we had created for each class.
        </p>
    <p>We ran simulations with a test audience and tweaked this to perfection.</p>

    <h2>v1: Metrics and Feedback</h2>
    <p>One week after launch we had 10% of the GOQii app DAU joining in for at least one live video class.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container-small">

        <span>Retention rate</span>
    </div>

    <p>Out of all the users that clicked the video notification, about 12% watched atleast 5 minutes, and 5% reached the end. We needed to understand why users were dropping off during the video. We also noticed a problem that 19% users were dropping off even before the video had loaded for them.</p>
    <p><b>We called 10 of these users to get feedback. Following were the results,</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users thought the classes were too long</li>
        <li>Users wanted more content in their regional language</li>
        <li>Users wanted to rewatch some of the videos</li>
        <li>Users wanted cooking videos, more home work out videos, and videos on mental wellness.</li>
    </ul>
        
    <p><b>We also spoke to the coaches about their experience,</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coaches found it too distracting to keep refering to a separate </li>
        <li>Coaches wanted to know when a user joined the class so they could welcome them</li>
        <li>Coaches wanted a place where they could view thier schedule</li>
        <li>Coaches wanted users to subscribe to their classes so that they could get notified about new classes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>v2: Building for the future</h2>
    <p>After bug fixing and some minor releases it was time to build version 2 of the product. We narrowed down the scope to the following items,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Coach side app for viewing schedule, hosting classes, and reading comments</li>
        <li>Introducing subscriptions</li>
        <li>Collecting Feedback after class</li>
        <li>Showing a list of Archived Classes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>v2: Metrics and Feedback</h2>
    <p>We passed on the collected feedback to the coaches, and this helped us improve our class completion rates from 5% to 12% in 2 months after the v2 launch (largely helped by the archive content). We saw a steady increase in the GOQii Play DAU, improvement in the adoption rate (with the help of notifications, emailers, and YouTube promotions, and we started tracking our retention rate on the feature.</p>

    <h2>v3: Solving for discovery</h2>
    <p>The focus of version 3 was to help users the classes they need. We finalised on the below feature set for the next release,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Categories and Search</li>
        <li>Coach Profile</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h2>v4: Monetising GOQii Play</h2>

    <p>The feature had lead to increased time spent on the platform. Users that watched videos on average made more purchases on the platform and showed better renewal rates.     
    <p>6 months after launching GOQii play, it was now time to monetise the feature. </p>
    <p>We used the in-app currency called “GOQii Cash” to allow users to purchase “Priority Questions”. These questions would be highlighted to the coach (this ensured that the question would get answered.</p>
    <p>We also launched a new subscription plan and made commenting a paid feature in the app.</p>

    <h2>Celebrity Shows</h2>
    <p>Once the core functionality of the product was completed, we invited celebrities to conduct shows on the platform to improve adoption and help acquire new users.</p>
    <p>We got,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>India’s ex-hockey captain Sardar Singh</li>
        <li>Bollywood actor and health icon of India Akshay Kumar</li>
        <li>Vikas Khanna</li>
        <li>Luke Coutihno</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h2>Impact and Future Plans</h2>
    <p>Through each release we improved our feature adoption rate and helped GOQii improve time spent on the app, and improve revenue numbers with a new subscription model.</p>
    <p>We will look to execute the following feature to further improve our platform,</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Personalisation of content:</b> We need to reach the right people with the right classes. We have content for all age groups and a lot of health issues. We need to make sure that the videos that the user is recommended are relevent to their needs.</li>
        <li><b>Live Quizzes:</b> With the growing popularity of live quizzing platforms like HQ Trivia, we see an opportunity to create something similar in our product. Health quizzes hosted by the coaches will be entertaining as well as educational for the user.</li>
        <li><b>Tutorials/Series:</b> Coaches will be able to create series like "Coach to 5K", or "30 day weight loss problem".</li>
        <li><b>Heart Rate integration:</b> Add Heart rate on the screen while the user attends a class.</li>        
    </ul>
